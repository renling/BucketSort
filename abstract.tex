We propose a conceptually simple oblivious sort and oblivious random permutation algorithms called bucket oblivious sort and bucket oblivious random permutation.
Bucket oblivious sort uses $6n\log n$ time (measured by the number of memory accesses) and $2Z$ client storage to ensure an error probability exponentially small in $Z$. 
This runtime is only $3\times$ slower than an insecure merge sort baseline;
for $2^{30}$ elements, it is $5\times$ faster than Bitonic sort,
the de facto oblivious sorting algorithm in practical implementations. 
%We thus recommend our algorithms as an attractive alternative to Bitonic Sort.

%Finally, we show that using our Bucket Sort as a meta-algorithm and leveraging additional algorithmic tricks,
%we can devise a new ``locality-friendly'' oblivious sorting algorithm that outperforms the state of the art (Asharov et al., Eurocrypt 2019) by an almost logarithmic factor in both runtime and locality.
